        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of our project is to finish a game of chess using a UR-10
          robot with a smart suction cup that can pick up flat chess pieces by
          implementing haptic search and negative pressure. And also implement
          positive pressure to place the chess piece more efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
        <p>
          This is an interesting project to us since we need to learn how to
          implement on a new robot arm that we never interact with in class, and
          the idea of the smart suction cup is also really compelling that we
          can pick up an object even if computer vision is not percise enough
          for a good suction spot.
        </p>

        <h3>Interestiing Problmes and Chanllenges:</h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of chanllenges and problems we met when we working on
          the project. But the most interesting ones are definitely implementing
          the haptic search correctly, and also tuning the pressure threshold
          when detecting whether the pieces are picked up or not.
        </p>

        <h3>Real World Applications:</h3>
        <p>
          Our project is useful for a lot of real world robotics applications
          includes providing people with decreased mobility a chance to play
          chess or some other boardgames, picking objects even when computer
          vision failed, and pick up adverserial objects that are difficult for
          grippers to deal with.
