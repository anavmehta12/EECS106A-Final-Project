        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of our project is to play a game of chess using a UR-10
          robot with a smart suction cup that can pick up custom chess pieces using
          haptic search.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
        <p>
          This is an interesting project since we wanted to work with a new robot infrastructure that we
          never interacted with in class, and smart suction cup is a very
          intriguing kind of end effector given that we can pick up an object without the need of computer vision or hardcoded
          movements
        </p>

        <h3>Interesting Problems and Challenges:</h3>
        <p>
          There were a lot of challenges and problems we were faced with when working on
          this project. One being the learning of a new robot framework however the
          most interesting and difficult involved fully implementing haptic search and
          tinkering with certain pressure values and step sizes in order
          to make our software work in the physical world.

        </p>

        <h3>Real World Applications:</h3>
        <p>
          Our project is applicable in the real world as it provides chess players a way to play chess
          in real life while still not having to interact with another person. But more seriously, it does
          provide people with decreased mobility a new way to play
          chess or similar boardgames.
