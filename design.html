        <h3>Functionality:</h3>

        <p>
          The desired functionality starts with the user inputting their desired
          move into the terminal and ends with the robot arm using the suction
          cup gripper to do pick and place operations. The robot arm plays the
          users move as well as a move of its own. To pick up a piece the UR-10
          robot arm must move its end effector to the appropriate location,
          activate a pull state the suction cup and lower slowly until a seal is
          formed. If the initial attempt to pick up the piece fails, the end
          effector moves toward the most probable location that a seal will be
          formed. The robot arm then moves the piece to the appropriate location
          switching between the suction states as needed. This continues until
          their has been a check mate, or the user surrenders.

        <h3>Design Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          The following is a list of our criteria needed for what we considered
          to be a successful implementation of the UR-10 with the smart suction
          cup gripper to play chess:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use computer vision to identify the center of the board and adjust
            mapping of board accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The terminal accepts a user input and returns the next move played,
            resulting in pick and place operation to move pieces according.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon an unsuccessful suction seal, the UR-10 move the end effector
            towards the most likely location for a better seal.
          </li>
          <li>
            The suction cup should be appropriate state (Push, Pull, Off)
            corresponding to the action or nonaction happening.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider chess edge cases. (i.e. Capturing, Castling, Promotion)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With this combination of design goals, the UR-10 robot arm should be
          able to repeatability and reliably play countless number of chess
          games. Additionally, it was important that we design our chess pieces
          such that it demonstrates appropriate use of haptic feedback search
          using the smart suction cup technology.

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <h4>Custom Chess Pieces:</h4>
        <p>
          Our team custom designed flat chess pieces in order to highlight the
          application of haptic search. The pieces were designed using the
          computer-aided design software OnShape, and are pictured below. When
          designing these pieces we ensured there was ample surface area for the
          gripper to form a seal, while adding still some degree of complexity.
          The some pieces have sharp corners and holes making it difficult for
          the haptic search to be successful. Further, we wanted the pieces to
          be light to demonstrate the need for a push state. These pieces are
          light enough such that when the section gripper is in the off state,
          the piece remains attached to the gripper due to a residual vacuum
          left within the system.

        <h4>Hardware and Electronics:</h4>
        <p>
          We built off the system provided by Dr. Jungpyo Lee. Pneumatically,
          the system consisted of a single solenoid to control the flow of air
          to an in line vacuum generator. The solenoid was electronically wired
          to a n-type MOSFET, whose gate pin was controlled by a ESP32
          microcontroller. In it's initial state, the system had no means for
          pushing air out of the suction cup end effector. Together with Dr
          Jungpyo Lee, we devised a new system which included push. This newly
          devised system saw the addition of 3 more solenoid-MOSFET pairs. The
          updated pneumatic lines and circuit are shown in the image below,
          accompanied by a schematic of the the circuit as well. Initially, we
          experimented with splitting the line using only two solenoids. The
          idea being the solenoids would be on separate lines and activate
          corresponding to being in a push or pull state. This did not work as
          intended air was escaping through the vacuum generator. We decided to
          get the third solenoid to isolate the vacuum generator when going into
          the push state.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          We out sourced the logic behind the game play to an open-source chess
          engine called Stockfish. Due to hardware limitations we were
          restricted to using an older version. We drew up a 24 in x 24 in chess
          board, resulting in squares that were 3 in x 3 in. We calculated the offsets from the center
          of the board to each file and rank and thus from a coordinate we could determine how to move across the board
          efficiently. Additionally, we assigned extra locations off
          the board for each teams captured pieces (Graveyard) and where Queens are kept to be promoted into.
          This way we could handle the common capture and the less frequent edge cases like promoting and castling.
