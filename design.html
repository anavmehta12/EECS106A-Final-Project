        <h3>Design Goals:</h3>
        The following is a list of our criteria needed for what we considered to be a successful implementation
        of the UR-10 with the smart suction cup gripper to play chess:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use computer vision to identify the center of the board 
            and adjust mapping of board accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The terminal accepts a user input and returns the next move played,
             resulting in pick and place operation to move pieces according.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon an unsuccessful suction seal, the UR-10 move the end effector towards 
            the most likely location for a better seal.
          </li>
          <li>
            The suction cup should be appropriate state (Push, Pull, Off) 
            corresponding to the action or nonaction happening.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot arm can recognize the current game using machine learing
            and computer vision so we don't need to record the game stats.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Decisions:</h3>
        <h4>Hardware and Electronics:</h4>
        <p>
          We built off the system provided by Dr. Jungpyo Lee. Pneumatically, the system consisted of a single solenoid to control the flow of air 
          to an in line vacuum generator. The solenoid was electronically wired to a n-type MOSFET, whose gate pin was controlled 
          by a ESP32 microcontroller. In it's initial state, the system had no means for pushing air out of the suction cup end effector. 
          Together with Dr Jungpyo Lee, we devised a new system which included push. This newly devised system saw the addition of 3 more 
          solenoid-MOSFET pairs. The updated pneumatic lines and circuit are shown in the image below, accompanied by a schematic of the the circuit as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, we experimented with splitting the line using only two solenoids. The idea being the solenoids would be on separate lines and activate 
          corresponding to being in a push or pull state. This did not work as intended air was 
          escaping through the vacuum generator. We decided to get the third solenoid to isolate the vacuum generator when going into the push state.
