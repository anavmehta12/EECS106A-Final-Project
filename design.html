        <h3>Design criteria and Desired Functionality:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The robot arm can pick up and place down a piece correctly as we
            desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot arm need to have the ability to perform its own move base
            on the current game situation so it can play with humans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform haptic search so it can pick up the chess pieces accurately
            even if we only have the rough idea of where the piece will be.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot arm need to detect and deal with the edge cases in chess
            such as upgrading and castling.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot arm can recognize the current game using machine learing
            and computer vision so we don't need to record the game stats.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Choices and Details:</h3>
        <p>
          Although the game we want the robot arm to perfrom is just a normal
          chess game, since we want to emphasize the idea of smart suction cup.
          We 3D printed our own chess pieces so that it is thin and flat that will
          be hard for a normal grippers to pick up. We also make our own chess
          board by cutting a wooden board that each square of the chess will be
          3 inch by 3 inch.
