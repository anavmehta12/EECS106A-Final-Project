        <h3>Yun Chung Chang </h3>
        <p>
          Yun Chung Chang is an EECS senior undergraduate transferred from De Anza College. 
          He is interested in the combination of computer vision and robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spending late hours in the lab, Yun implimented the color thresholding and helped design the prototypes for the chess board peices.
          Yun also built this website architecture from scratch. Yun was critical in debugging most of our issues, including and especially
          everything on the software side.

        <h3>Anav Mehta </h3>
        <p>
          Anav is an EECS major who transferred from De Anza Community College. 
          He is very interested in robotics and the integration with mechanical engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anav was instrumental in ensuring that all the game logic worked and was properly debugged. He fixed the haptic search and 
          trajectory phase bugs, as well as fully implemented the graveyard system. Anav also handled most of our written project proposals
          and checkins, ensuring that we were on track for due dates.

        <h3>Eric Bermudez </h3>
        <p>
          Eric is a Mechanical Engineering major interested in control theory and human machine interaction. 
          He is well-versed using OnShape and MatLab; and has a solid foundation in dynamics.</p>
        <p>
          After getting us access to the embodied dexterity lab at Berkeley,
          Eric designed, engineered, and integrated the entire positive pressure circuit and hardware from scratch. 
          Eric was later critical in debugging the loose circuit, and built most of our slide deck and chess board.

        <h3>Abraham Ramirez </h3>
        <p>
          Abraham is a EECS major on my 5th semster at UCB. He is well educated in machine learning, data structures, 
          computer architecture and variety of coding languauges. 
          He is interested in the dynamics of robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abraham's role in the project was to provide assistance with circuit assembly, debugging, and computer 
          vision integration. When the original project proposal became unfeasible due to hardware limitations, Abraham 
          and his team actively contributed to developing a new plan that aligned with the project criteria and worked 
          within the constraints of the UR10 robotic arm. Additionally, Abraham played a significant role in creating 
          and organizing the presentation slides, ensuring our work was communicated effectively

        <h3>Mara Lovric </h3>
        <p>Mara Lovric is an EECS major, currently exploring an interest in robotics.</p>
        <p>
          Mara was critical in 3D printing all of our parts, especially when the lab 3D printers were occupied and we scrambled to 
          find alternatives to get our peices constructed. Mara also helped construct the chess board, debug the trajectory, 
          game logic, and motion planning issues, construction of the slide deck, and engineering of our custom circuitry. 
        </p>

        <h3>Max Vink </h3>
        <p> 
          Max Vink is a double major in Computer Science and Political Science.
          He is interested in applying his studies to robotics and learning how to engineer physical things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Max helped make the roadmap for how to engineer the project. He built the initial chess game logic, 
          integrating the stockfish API with a game loop and telling the robot
          how to proceed with making the resulting virtual gamestate a physical boardstate with trajectory planning
          and pressure actuation. 
          He helped direct and film the demos, and was the first person to get utterly demolished by the robot in
          a full game of chess.
          Max also helped fix the haptic search, as well as construct the website and a few of the slides.
